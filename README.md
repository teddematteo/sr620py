SR620PY is a python library designed to perform measurements and apply custom configurations to a SR620 Universal Time Counter (Stanford Research Systems).

## Features

- Remotely apply a configuration to your SR620
- Start a measure or a set of measurements
- Start an Allan Variance set of measurements

## Installation

To use the library, install it by using `pip` command
```sh
pip install sr620py
```
`sr620py` requires `pyserial` and `tqdm` to work properly.

To upgrade the library:
```sh
pip install sr620py --upgrade
```

## How to use it
To **open a connection** with yout SR620 device, the corresponding **serial port** and **log file** path must be specified:
```python
from sr620py import *

device = SR620('/dev/ttyUSB0','mylogfile.log') #starts the connection
#...your code here...
device.close_connection()
```
If no log file is specified, the output will be written on your standard console.
> As soon as the connection is established, the current configuration of the device is read

### Start a measure
To start a measure, you need to specify the type of statistics you want to read. All the statistics are saved in constants starting with `STATISTICS_`:
```python
device.measure(STATISTICS_MEAN) #measure the mean
device.measure(STATISTICS_MAX) #measure the maximum
device.measure(STATISTICS_MIN) #measure the minimum
device.measure(STATISTICS_JITTER) #measure the jitter
```
```python
res = device.measure(STATISTICS_MEAN) #measure the mean...
print(res) #...and print the result
```
When a measure is started, a progress bar is shown in console. To disable it:
```python
device.measure(STATISTICS_MEAN,progress=False)
```
### Set of measurements
To start a set of measurements, the number of measurements and the statistics must be specified:
```python
res = device.start_measurement_set(STATISTICS_JITTER,10) #measure a set of 10 jitters...

for num in res:
    print(num) #...and print the result
```
To save the result in **csv file**, the csv file path must be specified:
```python
device.start_measurement_set(STATISTICS_JITTER,10,file_path='mycsv.csv') #save the result in a csv file
```
To start an **undefinite set of measurements**:
```python
res = device.start_measurement_set_forever(STATISTICS_MEAN,file_path='mycsv.csv')
print(res)
```
To block the measurement set, a Keyboard Interrupt `CTRL+C` command must be sent.
### Allan Variance
sr620py allows to start the measure of the Allan Variance of a signal over different number of samples (10,100,1000,...). The result is saved in a dictionary with this format:
`{10:value0,100:value1,1000:value2,...}`
To start the measurement of an Allan Variance set, the number of powers of ten must be specified:
```python
dct = device.start_measurement_allan_variance(3) #measure the Allan Variance for 10,100,1000 number of samples...
print(dct) #...and print the result
```
Also in this case the result can be saved in a csv file:
```python
dct = device.start_measurement_allan_variance(3,file_path='mycsv.csv')
```
To block the measurement set before the end, a Keyboard Interrupt `CTRL+C` command must be sent.
### Apply a custom configuration
sr620py finally allows to apply a custom configuration to the device. The complete command to apply the configuration is:
```python
device.set_custom_configuration(
    mode=MODE_FREQUENCY,
    source=SOURCE_A,
    jitter=JITTER_ALLAN,
    arming=ARMING_CENTISECOND,
    size=5,
    clock=CLOCK_EXTERNAL,
    clock_frequency=CLOCK_FREQUENCY_10_MEGAHZ,
)
```
The available options are contained in constants starting with: `MODE_`,`SOURCE_`,`JITTER_`,`ARMING_`,`CLOCK_`,`CLOCK_FREQUENCY_`. The size must be one of the following values: `1,2,5,1e1,2e1,5e1,1e2,2e2,5e2,1e3,2e3,5e3,1e4,2e4,5e4,1e5,2e5,5e5,1e6,2e6,5e6`.

The user can obviously specify only the options in which is interested in:
```python
device.set_custom_configuration(
    mode=MODE_COUNT,
    source=SOURCE_B,
) #only change the mode and the source
```
A set of methods can also be used in order to change the configuration:
```python
device.set_mode(MODE_FREQUENCY)
device.set_clock_frequency(CLOCK_FREQUENCY_10_MEGAHZ)
device.set_number_samples(100)
```
> Attention: when a configuration is sent to the device, it's possible that is not actually applied. To check the current configuration, the print option must me added to the methods:

```python
device.set_custom_configuration(
    ...,
    print=True
)
```
The result will be something like that:
```
-------------------------------------
***SR620 parameters configuration***
    Mode: freq
    Source: A
    Arming: 1s
    NumOfSamples: 100.0
    TypeOfJitter: STD
    Clock: int
    ClockFrequency: 10mhz
-------------------------------------
```
